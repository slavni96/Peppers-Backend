This very unusual pod shaped variety is believed to have been  transfered from South America to Europe by the Portuguese in the 18th century and is actually part of the species Capsicum baccatum var. pendulum.  The plants are quite large growing 3 to 4 ft tall and produce 30 to 50 extremely weird 3 or 4 flat winged, wrinkled almost flying saucer like 1 ½\" wide pods. The flesh of each pod is thin athough crisp to taste and they mature from green to red approximately 90-100 days after seedlings have emerged. The body of the pods have some detectable heat, but the wings are sweet and mild.",

      "description": "A variety named by Richard Sterling from seed collected in Cambodia.\nThe very productive and rather tall bushy variety is a  tabasco relative. The peppers  are approximately 2in long by 0.5in wide and grow erect on the plant.  They ripen from a beautiful yellow to an astonishing red colour. The pods make a delicious chile powder when dried but also have a wonderful fruity taste when eaten fresh.",

Plants are sturdy, hardy, and well branched, and may reach a height of 5 feet when well grown. Flowers are purple with greenish-purple stamens. The pendant fruits ripen from greenish-purple to purple-orange to red, and provide a colorful accent to the purple foliage. Fruits are small (3/8\" x 7/8\"), abundant, hot, and because they separate readily from the plant they are easy to harvest. Compared to 'Royal Black', 'Bellingrath Gardens Purple' is more variegated. Recommended enthusiastically for ornamental gardens. 85 days.",

      "description": "Originating from the Yucutan Peninsula in Mexico, this pepper variety is FEROCIOUSLY HOT and is thought to be the second hottest chile pepper variety on the planet measuring a scorching 445,000 scoville units. This makes it twice as hot as a standard Habanero Chile and over 80 times hotter than an Jalapeno Pepper! The slightly wrinkled chiles are approximately 1 inch wide by 1.5 inches long and are similiar in shape to the Habanero. The chiles ripen from lime green to a brilliant red in 110 days and are produced on very productive plants that reach 30 inches tall. As well as the blistering heat, they have a lovely fruity flavour which makes them an excellent choice for use in salsa's, marinades and of course, in hot sauce. Note: An immature pod is shown here.",

Many hybridised varieties have since been developed. So named for their resemblance to the familiar fruit, cherry peppers are round and red. They range in pungency from mild to moderately hot. Cherry peppers are sold fresh, and also are commonly pickled and sold in jars. Scoville units: 0-3,500.",

Once growing the plant sprawls, stems are very thin and the plant has very small, delicate white flowers.  Not many pods in the first year, but easy to over winter indoors and second year should be covered in pods.  Does not grow very tall, makes an attractive indoor pepper.",

      "description": "Chile de arbol is a mild to quite hot pepper popular in western Mexico, where they are sometimes called pico de pajaro (bird beak) or cola de rata (rat tail). Plants are extremely vigorous, growing upto 120cm is a single season hence the translation of 'De Arbol' which means 'small tree' or 'Tree like'. They should be planted at least three feet apart. The slender pendant shaped fruits grow to around 10cm in length and mature from light green to dark red. Often dried and used by the Mexicans to make decorative wreaths or 'Ristras'. Red, slender pepper, up to 3\" long. Originally from the Oaxaco and Jalisco states in Mexico.",

      "description": "The Red Savina Habanero was reputed to be the worlds hottest Chile pepper weighs in at a whooping 577,000 Scoville Units!!! (thats before the Naga Morich/Dorset Naga came long). Its is also the first habanero to receive USDA plant-protection certificate.. At around 50 times as hot as a Jalapeno, it is one of the prime ingredients in the manufacture of the disabling Pepper spray used by Police forces around the world. Extreme caution must be taken when handling this pepper which has been known to blister sensitive skin. These firebombs grow on medium sized 2-3ft plants, with each plant producing up to 50 bright red coloured wrinkled fruits which reach maturity approx 100 days after transplanting.",

      "description": "This legendary Italian heirloom was introduced to the U.S. by Guiseppe Nardello in 1887.  A favorite from the southern part of Italy, these productive 2ft plants can yield upto a dozen peppers. Although technically a frying pepper, this is one of the sweetest non-bell peppers you'll ever taste. Bright red, 6 to 7 inch long peppers are only about 1 in. wide, and taper from the shoulder to tip, with a curving, somewhat wrinkled appearance. They are great for adding to salads or cooking into stir-fries. No matter if you use it fresh or cooked, its flavour remains very sweet. Expect large yields. 80 days.",

The variety was developed in the mid 1970's by Dr Nakayama as a result of a bredding program at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), home of the Chile Pepper Institute.\nPlants grow easily and vigourously and are surprisingly small in comparison to the gigantic pods growing between 24\" to 36\" high. Up to 30 pods may grow on a single plant which ripen from green to a deep red approximately 80 days after transplanting seedlings.\n\nDue to the pod size and mild heat quotient (500 to 2,500 SHU), Big Jim is  perfect for making decorative “ristras” as well as the classic (and very tasty) chile relleno dish.  \n\nTo make Chile Relleno's, toast, peel and de-seed ripe chiles. Stuff them with your favorite plain or herbed cheese (cheddar cheeses work well). In a small bowl, beat two eggs with a dash of salt and a tablespoon of flour to make a light batter. Dip each stuffed pepper into the batter before frying in hot olive orvegtable oil in a heavy skillet. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with a bit of additional cheese, top broil and serve with a fresh salsa. You can also add diced, cooked chicken or beef to the cheese stuffing if you wish or any other combinations you wish to try. Delicious!!.",

Bosland and Gonzalez using a pedigree breeding method that included hybridization and repeated single plant selections and was finally released in 1993. It is used both as an ornamental on wreaths and a ground powder in cooking",

Pequins do not take well to cultivation and must be hand picked so are not widely available in supermarkets.  Plants fruit best in second year and should be brought indoors to overwinter. \nIn Mexico both fresh green and dry red chile pequins are available. The green eaten fresh as a condiment or in salsas; the red ripe dry ones used in cooking and ground into chile blends. Very hot! I use both to make chile pequin jelly. Other names: bird, chile bravo (wild), chile del monte (woodlands).",

It has a similar apple-cherry tomato flavour. Like the Habanero, it is spherical, although rather more squashed in shape and it is smaller, 3.25-4 cm in diameter. Native to the Caribbean, it is available in the UK in green, yellow, orange, white, brown and red as well as multi-toned.",

Until a couple of years ago nobody knew this pepper, but these days everyone in Italy knows it. Why?\nFranco Neri is a comic that created a funny character from Soverato. This character loved peppers, especially the one from his home town, and he continuously talked about this mythic pepper.\nThe character was very funny and became famous, making this peperoncino very well known. The town of Soverato took this chance to increase the revenue from tourism, and now you can find all kinds of “peperoncino di Soverato” with different shapes, heat, colors etc.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot say it is a variety yet, but the name “peperoncino di Soverato” has to be intended as a generic name indicating all the peppers grown in the Soverato region.",

Growers today cannot keep up with demand and tabasco peppers are imported from Columbia and Central America to be mashed in Louisiana. The tabasco plant can grow upto 4-6 feet tall and is just loaded with slender 1.5in upright pods which mature from light green to orange and then to red approximately 75 days after transplanting. Originally from somewhat swampy regions it prefers hot and humid conditions for maximum productivity. 50,000-80,000 SHU.",

They grow wild in Mexico and the southern U.S. (including Florida), but are difficult to get to germinate in the home garden.

These tall elegent plants produce small marble like peppers less than 1cm in diameter and tend to fruit best in second year and should be brought indoors to overwinter. Traditionally, they are harvested by breaking off whole branches and letting the little balls of fire dry before shaking them off and in Mexico tepins are used to season just about everything on the table. ## HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR HEAT LOVERS ##",

In Caribbean regions it is also known as 7 pot as one pod is said to provide enough heat to spice up 7 pots of stew.  Pods are habenaro like in there shape but have the characteristic 'pimpling' as found on another fearsome variety - the Naga Morich. Unusually the proportion of Placental tissue is very high - a allusion to why this pepper is so outrageously hot.  We now see this pepper in various colours - red, yellow, brown, white and burgundy.  No doubt purple will be along soon, followed by Cappuchino, Dusty Pink...",

Bhut Jolokia translates to 'Ghost chilli' probably due to its ghostly bite.  Raja Mircha means 'King of Chillies'. \n\nReports from Assam growers indicate the typical height of Bih Jolokia to be in the range of 45 to120 cm.  Like other varieties of the Chinense species, the leaf surface has the characteristic crinkle look and the flowers are pendant, with creamy white corollas, often with a touch of light green. Fruits are 5 to 8.5 cm in length, 2.5 to 3 cm in diameter (at shoulder), with an undulating surface.\n\nHowever it doenst matter what its called, under the right growing conditions these chiles are blisteringly hot with recent tests indicating a heat level of 1,041,427 Scoville Heat Units.\n\nOnly a few of its closely related Bangladeshi cousin can lay claim such outrageous heat levels.",

It is believed to be very closely related to its Indian cousin, the Bhut jolokia (Bih jolokia) and extreme care should be taken when handling these firebombs.  In recent tests, one Naga Morich pod registered 1,598,227 SHU.  The thin walled wrinkled pods have a high degree of variability in shape although they are generally wedge shaped with three locules and average about 2 inches long by 1 inch wide. They ripen from a rich green through to yellow/orange and finally to a rich red approximately 120 days after transplanting. The extremely long, curved and annular constriction of the Calyx at junction with the peduncle is also a notable feature of this variety.\nPlants are large and bushy, with ours growing almost 3ft tall. Leaves are ovate in shape and pale green in colour. Plants also display multiple pods and flowers per node (often 5-6 pods per node) and corollas possess the characteristic greenish tinge of other varieties in the chinense species.\nIt is used sparingly (and with great care!) in Bengali cookery and is thought to originate from Northern Bangladesh.",
